<h1>Hacked Hogwarts Student List</h1>
<br>
This is a final assignment of the Just JavaScript theme at KEA. The purpose was to code in Vanilla JavaScript so we learn the basics, starting from the fundamental concepts and building up to more complex topics. It covers topics such as <strong>variables, data types, operators, functions, loops, and objects.</strong> By the end of the theme, I had a good understanding of JavaScript and I was able to build basic web applications and interact with APIs.
